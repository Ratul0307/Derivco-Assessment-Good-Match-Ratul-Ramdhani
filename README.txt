Good Day Derivco 

I am Ratul Ramdhani and this is my Good Match Graduate Assessment

This Assessment is made in C# Console Application

What my Application can do:
--------------------------------
1) It can do the Good Match Process
2) Can take a .csv file as an input and run processes on it (Discussed further down)
3) Can accept 2 string as an input (This was an optional which I managed to complete)
4) Can Log Execution times of various Methods and Process, aswell as save those recordings into seperate text files (This was an optional which I managed to complete) 



Good Match Process: (Option 1 in Console Application Menu)
-----------------------
1) In this Process, I made the system accept 2 strings from the user (First name , Second Name)
2) The system then takes these strings, runs them through a method to check for the number of occurences for each letter
3) Once thats done, the result gets store and put into a Percentage Calculation method which calculates the Percentage match of the 2 string.
4) Depending on the match, you will get one of two possible sentences.


CSV File: (Option 2 in the Console Application Menu)
------------------------
1) In this Process, the user will input a file path to a .csv file that they would like processing
2) The system will take that CSV file, process it and remove duplicates and order them alpherbetically
3) After the data has been sorted, the system will take the data and seperate it into Male and Female Lists
4) Next the system will take those 2 lists and compare them against one another one by one in a modified Good Match Process
5) Percentage Matches will get calculated for each combination
6) Next, each combination will be displayed along with they Percentage match and store those results
7) Finally the system will output these results to a "output.txt" file, found in the bin folder in the Application Directory (..\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1\)
 

Logs:
------------
1) I managed to incorporate Logs into this application
2) Logs run on both the Good Match Process aswell as the CSV File Process
3) These logs measure Execution time for each process in both Processes
4) Each Process has their own .txt file that their Logs get saved to
5) For the Good Match Process, its .txt file is called (GoodMatchLogFile.txt) and is found in the same Directory as the output.txt file (..\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1\)
6) For the CSVFile Process, its .txt file is called (CSVLogFile.txt) and is found in the same Directory as the output.txt file (..\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1\)


Thank you for this Opportunity
I hope that you find my application to your satisfaction.
I have tried to meet all the requirements to the best of my ability
